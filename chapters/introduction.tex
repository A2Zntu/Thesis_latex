In recent year, the information of derivatives market plays an increasingly crucial role in financial markets. There are multiple reasons why option market are vital for investors. One, informed traders may choose to trade in derivative markets since they can camouflage with noise traders by trading different option contracts on one specific security \parencite{easley1998option}. Another, authors such as \textcite{black1973pricing}, \textcite{mayhew1995allocation}, \textcite{fleming1996trading}, among others, argue that widened financial leverage and narrowed transaction costs may encourage informed traders to trade in the option market instead of the equity market,
Third, unlike stock market, there are no short selling constraints in option market. Therefore, the characteristics of an option contract are informational and worthy to investigate. However, to what extent has it been supported by empirical works? 

It has been a fierce debate whether the trading information from derivative markets lead the underlying markets. Prior studies hold different arguments toward this topic. Relevant papers, like \textcite{manaster1982option}, \textcite{anthony1988interrelation}, \textcite{chakravarty2004informed}, \textcite{cremers2010deviations}, \textcite{xing2010does} have found that the information from option market take the lead of the information from stock market. When informed traders recieved private information, they prefer to trade in option market since there are several advatanges we mentioned in the first paragraph. Furthermore, plentiful literature address that the informed trading in option market elucidate the process of price discovery, and the information contained in option price and volume would eventually get incoperated into underlying prices.While, other studies like \textcite{chan1993option}, \textcite{stephan1990intraday} find no evidence that option prices can lead stock prices. 

Nethertheless, after the sequential model built in \textcite{easley1998option}, myriad literature tried to capture the information from option market. Studies like \textcite{doran2007there}, \textcite{doran2010implications} and \textcite{atilgan2015implied} examined the impact on future asset returns of information contained in the implied volatility skewness. Others like \textcite{chan2002informational} and \textcite{pan2006information} found ordered imbalance in option volume facilitates the predictability in future asset returns. Apart from that, \textcite{bali2009volatility} and \textcite{cremers2010deviations} employ the call-put implied volatilty spread (CPIV) to construct portfolios. Moreover, they prove the put-call parity contain information about future stock returns by longing the highest CPIV portfilio and shorting the lowest CPIV porfolio with positive and significant alpha.   

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis on the examination of the interrelation between option and index markets. First, rather than investigating on stock market, we focus mainly on the index -- S\&P 500. Since most prior literature discuss informational linkage between option and stock markets, few of them had mentioned about index market. One literature, \textcite{atilgan2015implied},  has investigated on S\&P 500 option and index market, however, it employ the way of implied volatilty skewness rather than implied volatilty spreads. We focus on the latter and discover different results from them. In addition, another reason we choose to explore S\&P 500 rather than individual stocks is that index are not allowed to short comparing with stocks, so we believe there are more incentives for investors to trade in option markets first from the aspect of liquidity.

Second, the previous studies primarily deliberate over the option information on daily frequency. We would like to investigate the experiments on intra-day frequency. Furthermore, prior studies data are mainly constructed by "highest closing bid price" and "lowest closing ask price", which only capture the option information of 5-minutes interval before option market close. Therefore, we would like to test whether the predictability power is stronger in open period, middle period or close period.
         
Based on the CPIV propsed by \textcite{cremers2010deviations}, we refine this approach and derive an intraday version. We partition a single trading day to 14 intervals, and each interval we only include 5-minutes long data in case the put-call parity would be unbalanced due to major difference between the underlying prices in call and put options\footnote{Apart from the above reason, there are several causes that are responsible for the deviation of put-call parity, short sell constraints, the early exercise value of American options, transaction costs, taxes, to name a few}. In each interval, we examine all the possible option pairs and pick up the valid ones to compose a representative CPIV.

Our main results are simply summarized. To start with, the results display an intermarket relation between quote-data CPIV and contemporaneous index return. However, there is no predictive power toward one-day ahead index return\footnote{We also practice a robustness check on trade-data CPIV. Surprisingly, the $CPIV_{10:30}$ has strong predictability to forcast a one-day ahead index return}. We suggest that these intraday CPIV are enormously informational on index return during the identical day, but once the market close and open again in next day, the price of index would soon be adjusted during the first couple minutes. Therefore, it is even harder to generate a information gap from insider to noise trader.  

Next, we focus on intraday index return, and the empirical results express the open interval implied volatility spreads -- $CPIV_{08:30}$, has intense predictability toward the intraday half-hours cumulated returns. The adjusted $R^{2}$ range from 50.5\% to 23.6\% as hours decay during the rest of the day. All other intervals CPIV have no such powerful preditability as $CPIV_{08:30}$, the result again proves that the most informational interval is the first interval no matter on daily frequency and intraday frequency.    

Finally, we also conduct tests to yield further evidence for our information-based hypothesis. Following \textcite{atilgan2015implied}, our finding presents that the periods with high sentiment index are more senstive to information distributing between markets. Hence, the relation between CPIV and returns is significantly stronger during the particular periods as previous studies suggested. In \textcite{pan2006information}, \textcite{chang2018implied}, they also examine the tests on different stock liquidity and option liquidity periods. They all agree that during the periods with low stock liquidity or high option liquidity, the predictabilty on future asset returns increases. We segregate the periods by option liquidity, and the emperical results demonstrate the above ideas, where the coefficients of interval CPIV are larger and positive in high option liquidity periods. Overall, these results convey that information explanation is supported by empirical anaylsis. 

The remainder of paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe our research hypothesis, In Section 3, we describe our methedology and data. Section 4 presents the main empirical results on predicting index returns. Section 5 provides additional evidence for the information explanation. Section 6 concludes.
