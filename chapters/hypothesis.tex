\textcite{pan2006information} claim that there is no evidence to prove the informed trading in the index market via performing a regression of the next-day index returns on open-buy put-call ratios. It is a common belief that informed traders tend to hold private information in the firm-specific level rather than market-wide level. Therefore, we first exclude the possibility that the predictability of the index market may come from informed-trading. 

In our research, we articulate that the intraday CPIV may come from the trading information in the previous day and the news beyond market close. Hence, we would like to see interval in which contains information toward the contemporaneous index prices and next-day index prices. Apart from prior studies, which only possess the best-bid and best-offer of call and put option price within 5 minutes before market close, we apply prior approaches to establish CPIV of distinct interval in a single trading day. We assume that the trading information and news in the previous day would also reflect in other intervals. In fact, we discuss whether it is appropriate to use the last 5-minutes best bid and best offer to represent the option information in daily frequency. Would it be another chance that other intervals may also be crucial roles in price discovery?

\item[Hypothesis 1:] The open and mid intervals may also contain important information toward index returns

\textcite{bergsma2018intraday} spans the results from \textcite{easley1998option} that intraday signed options to stock ratios (O/S) have strong stock returns predictability especially in the first 30 minutes of market open. They make a statement that the first half hour of trading has predictive power for the remainder of the trading day. In line with this study, we believe that CPIV also reflects the market sentiment like O/S. Consequently, we suggest that S\&P 500 index options carry information toward expected index returns, and the information would gradually get incorporated into the index market as time flows.
