\textcite{pan2006information} considers that there is no evidence to prove the informed trading in the index market via performing an regression of the next-day index returns on open-buy put-call ratios. It is a common believe that informed traders tend to hold private information in firm-specific level rather than market-wide level. Therefore, we first exclude the possibility that the predictability of index market may comes from informed-trading. 

In our research, we articulate the intraday CPIV may comes from yesterday trading information and the news beyond market close. Hence, we would like to see in which interval may also contain information toward the contemporaneous index prices and next-day index prices. Apart from prior studies, which possess the best-bid and best-offer of call and put option price within 5 minutes before market close. On top of that, we apply prior approaches to establish CPIV of every interval in a single trading day. We assume that yesterday trading information and news would also reflect in other intervals. In fact, we discuss whether it is appropriate to use the last 5-minutes best bid and best offer to represent the option information in daily frequency. Would it be another chance that other intervals may also be crucial roles in price discovery?

\item[Hypothesis 1:] The open and mid intervals may also contain important information toward index returns

\textcite{bergsma2018intraday} spans the results from \textcite{easley1998option} that intraday signed option to stock ratios (O/S) have strong stock return predictability especially in the first 30 minutes of market open. They make a statemtent that the first half hour of trading has predictive power for the remainder of the trading day. In line with this study, we believe CPIV also reflect the market sentiment like O/S. Consequently, we suggest S\&P 500 index option carry information toward the index market, and the information would get incorporated into the index market as time flows.
