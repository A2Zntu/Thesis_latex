We propose the problem of finding a broadcast median in weighted tree with time constraint under the postal model. Given a weighted tree $T=(V,E)$ with time constraint $t$, the overall delay of a vertex $v\in{V(T)}$, is the minimum sum of the transmission time required to send a message from $v$ to all vertices in $T$, and the medain is the node that has the minimum overall delay. Time constraint $t$ denotes that all nodes in $T$ should receive the message before time $t$.\\
\indent In this thesis, we propose an $O(min(t,n)\cdot{n^4})$ time complexity algorithm that uses dynamic programming and Hungarian algorithm to find a median in $T$ with time constraint.\\
