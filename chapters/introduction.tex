Probabilistic inference has become a core technology in AI,
largely due to developments in graph-theoretic methods for the 
representation and manipulation of complex probability 
distributions.  Whether in their guise as 
directed graphs (Bayesian networks) or as undirected graphs (Markov 
random fields), \emph{probabilistic graphical models} have a number 
of virtues as representations of uncertainty and as inference engines.  
Graphical models allow a separation between qualitative, structural
aspects of uncertain knowledge and the quantitative, parametric aspects 
of uncertainty...
